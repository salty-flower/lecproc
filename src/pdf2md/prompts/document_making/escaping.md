# Escaping

## Square brackets "[]"

**In main content (Markdown)**:
Escape (both opening and closing) with a SINGLE backslash (e.g., \[ and \]) if you want to use them literally.
Don't escape if they are part of a link or image.

**In math environments (double or single dollar sign enclosed)**:
No escaping required. It is an error to prepend backslash.

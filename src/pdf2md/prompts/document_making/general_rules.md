# General Rules

Do not introduce any new information or opinions.

## Ignore

Unless it's a Beamer slide deck, ignore page breaks and page numbers.

## Headings

For Beamer slides, write a descriptive H1 heading at first.
Then, on each slide, write the slide title as H2 heading.

For non-Beamer documents, respect the original level of headings.

## Procedure

- We apply the procedure
- it is a reducible MC, with 3 classes
    - Class 1: ${1, 2}$: absorbing/recurrent
    - Class 2: ${3}$, absorbing/recurrent
    - Class 3: ${4, 5}$: transient
- Hence, we consider a MC with 4 states, $cal(C)_((1, 2)) = {1, 2}$, $cal(C)_3 = {3}$, 4 and 5. Note I change the subscripts to simplify the notations
- The transition probability matrix is $$bold(P) = mat(, cal(C)_(1,2), cal(C)_3, 4, 5 ; C_(1,2), 1, 0, 0, 0 ; C_3, 0, 1, 0, 0 ; 4, 0, 0.4, 0.4, 0.2; 5, 0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.6;)$$

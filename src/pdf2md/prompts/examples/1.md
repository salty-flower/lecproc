## Global balance equations

- To find the limiting dist., we have to solve $$bold(pi) = bold(pi) bold(P)$$
- These equations are called the _global balance equations_.
- Element-wise, it is equivalent with $$pi_j = sum_(k in S) pi_k P_(k j)$$
- LHS: the current prob. at state $j$, $pi_j$
- RHS: $$sum_(k in S) pi_k P_(k j) =& sum_(k in S) P(X_n = k) P(X_(n+1) = j | X_n = k)\ =&"the prob. of being at state "j" in next step."$$
- the prob. in one state equals to the prob. that the walker will arrive at this state from other states in one step

## Step 2. Entering Prob

- Starting from state 1 or 2.
  - They are in the absorbing class $cal(C)_(1, 2)$
  - So, $pi_(cal(C)_(1,2)|1) = 1$, $pi_(cal(C)_(1,2)|2) = 1$, and the prob. to other classes are all 0.
- Starting from state 3.
  - State 3 is an absorbing state.
  - So, $pi_(cal(C)_(3 | 3)) = 1$, and the prob. to other classes are all 0.
- Starting from state 4 or 5
  - Let $T = min( { n: X_n in cal(C)_(1,2) " or " cal(C)_3 } )$.
  - Let $u_i = op("P")(X_T in cal(C)_(1 , 2) | X_0 = i)$, $i = 4,5$. By first step analysis, $$cases(u_(1,2) &= 1 \ u_3 &= 0 \ u_4 &= 0.4 u_3 + 0.4 u_4 + 0.2 u_5 \ u_5 &= 0.2 u_(1,2) + 0.2 u_4 + 0.6 u_5)$$
  - Solve it, there is $u_(cal(C)_(1,2)|4) = u_4 = 0.2$, $u_(cal(C)_(1,2)|5) = u_5 = 0.6$.
  - Further, $u_(cal(C)_(3|4)) = 1 - u_4 = 0.8$, $u_(cal(C)_3 | 5) = 1 - u_5 = 0.4$.

## TikZ for Diagrams

Try writing diagrams with TikZ.

### Available Packages

amsmath. amstext. amsfonts. amssymb. array.
tikz-cd. circuitikz. chemfig. pgfplots. tikz-3dplot.

### Complete Example

Below is a complete example of a TikZ diagram.
In your output, you should enclose the diagram in a code block with the language `tikz`, too.

```tikz
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}

% Draw states in triangular arrangement
\node[draw, circle, minimum size=1.5cm] (rainy) at (0,3) {R};
\node[draw, circle, minimum size=1.5cm] (sunny) at (-2,0) {S};
\node[draw, circle, minimum size=1.5cm] (cloudy) at (2,0) {C};

% Self-loops
\draw[->, thick] (rainy) to [out=120, in=60, looseness=8] node[above] {0.2} (rainy);
\draw[->, thick] (sunny) to [out=200, in=240, looseness=8] node[left] {0.6} (sunny);
\draw[->, thick] (cloudy) to [out=340, in=20, looseness=8] node[right] {0.2} (cloudy);

% Transitions from rainy
\draw[->, thick] (rainy) to [bend right=20] node[left] {0.6} (sunny);
\draw[->, thick] (rainy) to [bend left=20] node[right] {0.2} (cloudy);

% Transitions from sunny
\draw[->, thick] (sunny) to [bend right=20] node[left] {0.1} (rainy);
\draw[->, thick] (sunny) to [bend right=20] node[below] {0.3} (cloudy);

% Transitions from cloudy
\draw[->, thick] (cloudy) to [bend left=20] node[right] {0.7} (rainy);
\draw[->, thick] (cloudy) to [bend right=30] node[below] {0.1} (sunny);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```

## Descriptive Text for Pictures

If it's a picture, write a descriptive text right at where the picture is.

## LaTeX for Formulas and Symbols

Always write formulas and symbols in LaTeX format.

**Block-Level:**

- Use double dollar signs (`$$`) for block-level LaTeX formulas.
- Scenarios:
- Formulas with **no text** before and after are likely block-level.
- Formulas containing multiple lines (e.g., `\begin{align*} ... \\ ... \end{align*}`) **must** be block-level.

### Vectors and matrices

For vectors and matrices, write them in Boldface: `\bm{the symbol}`.
When it's Latin and upright preferred, use `\mathbf{the content}`.

### Border matrices

$\bordermatrix$ isn't supported in MathJax. To bypass this, use $\mybordermatrix{<whatever content in the main matrix>}{<the leftmost column, serving as column headers>}{<the topmost row, serving as row headers>}$
Example:
$$
\mathbf{P} =
\mybordermatrix{
P_0 & P_1 & P_2 & \cdots & P_m \\
P_m & P_0 & P_1 & \cdots & P_{m-1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
P_1 & P_2 & P_3 & \cdots & P_0
}{0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ m}{0&1&2&&\ldots&&m}
$$

Other matrices, for example, `pmatrix`, are still supported, so you don't need `mybordermatrix` for vectors.

## Escaping

Escape square brackets (both opening and closing) with a SINGLE backslash (e.g., \[ and \])
in the main content (i.e. not in latex formula, not in code block) unless they are part of a link or image.

## Ignore

Unless it's a Beamer slide deck, ignore page breaks and page numbers.

## General Rules

Do not introduce any new information or opinions.
